# Crack64Bit

This program will return possible world seeds enrtiely based on data from trees in Minecraft.  Naturally a task like this would have some limitations this program is quite time consuming to run as is limited to "Text Seeds". To summarize seeds in Minecraft are 64 bits (2^64 possible unique seeds) but a 32 bit intger hash is used genrrate seeds containing text. Meaning text seeds have 2^32 possible seeds MUCH less than 2^64. In theroy this program *could* find whole 64 bit world seeds but that is EXTREMELY impractical.   





## Program Use 
This project requires you to have a few things installed: 

- [The Cuda Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)

- [Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)

```bash 
Git clone https://github.com/TatertotGr8/Treecracker.git

```



#Java
 




To run the first stage of this project download the zip file. 
Superate  the file "Crack64Bit_The_Beginning" from the group I would suggest to drag it onto you desktop. 
The executeable file "GPU.exe" does all the magic for you, click that and watch your power bill rise. 
You can see a screen recoding of this procsss [here](https://youtu.be/m_Qbvg5l4D8). 


After this proces you would recive a out.txt file.  Compile this with the second program "Crack64Bit_The_Sequel"
