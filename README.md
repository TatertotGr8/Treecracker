# Crack64Bit

This program will return possible world seeds enrtiely based on data from trees in Minecraft.  Naturally a task like this would have some limitations this program is quite time consuming to run as is limited to "Text Seeds". To summarize seeds in Minecraft are 64 bits (2^64 possible unique seeds) but a 32 bit intger hash is used genrrate seeds containing text. Meaning text seeds have 2^32 possible seeds MUCH less than 2^64. In theroy this program *could* find whole 64 bit world seeds but that is EXTREMELY impractical.   

This project is heavily inspired by work by the Minecraft@home community. For the unfamiliar the Minecraft@home community specilizes in project based technical Minecraft projects, from seed cracking to building computers in Minecraft. The community is credited for a lot of the large scale Minecraft seed reversals specifically [the finding of the title screen panoramas](https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/projects/1-13-1-16-panoramas.html) or the [Pack.png project](https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/projects/packpng.html). To me it was incredible that from a _random_  Minecraft screenshot the exact world could be found. Many aspects went into these

Chnageing the program to sreach for a diffent world seed requires more knowlage and understanding relateing to Minecraft seed cracking, information found in the writen documentation [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-tqtsDtqdalQDEEsopy5CnU4O1-bL9xtSGgOIrrxzI/edit#)
